Email is the workhorse of digital communication. It's one of the oldest
decentralized messaging platforms, and we must keep implementations up to date
with new standards/techniques/programming languages.

## Call for Participation

We'll have a "**Modern Email**" devroom again at FOSDEM 2026, and we're looking
for speakers!

We want to get together as email developers/users, learn about each other's
projects, have technical discussions, exchange implementation/operational
experiences, and share plans and visions for the future of email.

FOSDEM is an annual conference about free and open source software. It takes
place at the ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium on 31 Jan/1 Feb 2026. See
https://fosdem.org/2026/.

The devroom will be **held on Saturday 31 January 2026** (full day).
The **submission deadline for talks is Wednesday, 10 December, 2025** (end of
day).

**Please distribute this CfP as widely as possible to interested parties!**

## Topics

Some suggestions for talks:

* Overview of the current state of email (as a keynote).
* Your free/open source software project(s) related to email. From demo to details.
* Current developments, upcoming standards, e.g. [JMAP](https://jmap.io),
  [structured email](https://structured.email), ...
* Efforts to modernize our email ecosystem, e.g., through implementations in
  modern languages.
* Integrating email with other software, e.g., through APIs.
* Message/transport security/authenticity.
* Experiences with deliverability, email operations, anti-spam, hosting, ...
* Related technologies such as calendaring/PIM.
* Visionary talks
* ...

## Submission

We ask for a short talk abstract (+ proposed duration) and a speaker biography
(+ contact info). Any material that shows your affinity to the field is also
appreciated, e.g., a collection of links to your work, talks, projects, blog
posts, etc.

Submissions must be made through Pretalx (https://fosdem.org/submit) no later
than Wednesday, 10 December, 2025.

The suggested duration for a talk is **25 minutes** (20 minutes presentation +
5 minutes Q&A). However, we *explicitly* invite you to propose the best
duration for your talk. If the best way to present your project is a **5-minute
lightning talk**, we'll happily arrange a lightning session!

Depending on the proposals, we may contact you to adapt the time of the session
to fit the devroom schedule.

Once the devroom schedule is finalized, we will contact you to help you prepare
your talk.

### Pre-FOSDEM Hackathon (Friday before FOSDEM)

We will organize an informal **pre-FOSDEM email hackathon on Friday before
FOSDEM** (30 January). Please contact one of the organizers through email or
the matrix channel and/or put your name up at
https://github.com/modern-email/FOSDEM-26/wiki/Hackathon-and-Dinner
if you're interested in joining.

We need to know who'll attend by January 25 due to building access registration
policies.

### Friends-of-Email Dinner

Following last year's good practice, we will reserve a table for an informal
"friends of email" dinner/drinks session, on Saturday evening, January 31, at
the end of the devroom day.  Put your name up at
https://github.com/modern-email/FOSDEM-26/wiki/Hackathon-and-Dinner
and/or contact one of the organizers so we can guess the group size (last year
we reserved for 15 and 40+ showed up). Venue proposals welcome as well.
