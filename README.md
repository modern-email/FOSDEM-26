Email is the workhorse of digital communication. It's one of the oldest
decentralized messaging platforms, and we must keep implementations up to date
with new standards/techniques/programming languages.

## Call for Participation

The "**Modern Email**" developer room is new at FOSDEM and seeks speakers,
volunteers, and participants! We want to get together as email
developers/users, learn about each other's projects, have technical
discussions, exchange implementation/operational experiences, and share plans
and visions for the future of email.

The Devroom will be **held on saturday 31 january 2026** (full day), with primarily
talks on the schedule. The **submission deadline for talks is Wednesday, December 10, 2025**.

* **Speaker**: As a speaker, you're invited to present your work in the developer room.
* **Volunteer**: As a volunteer, you would be helping us out during the sessions.
* **Participant**: As a participant, whether introverted or extroverted, you
  are excellent to everyone and make the day!

**Please distribute this CfP as widely as possible to interested parties!**

## Topics

Some suggestions for talks:

* Overview of the current state of email (as a keynote)
* Your free/open source software project(s) related to email. From demo to details.
* Current developments, upcoming standards, e.g. [JMAP](https://jmap.io),
  [structured email](https://structured.email), ...
* Efforts to modernize our email ecosystem, e.g., through implementations in modern languages.
* Integrating email with other software, e.g., through APIs.
* Message/transport security/authenticity.
* Experiences with deliverability, email operations, anti-spam, hosting, ...
* Related technologies such as calendaring/PIM.
* Visionary talks
    * Where should email be in 10 years?
    * Can we add end-to-end encryption (to the masses) through, e.g., MLS?
    * Can we provide simple solutions for on-prem (private) hosting?
* ...

## Submission

We ask for a short talk abstract (+ proposed duration) and a speaker biography
(+ contact info). Any material that shows your affinity to the field is also
appreciated, e.g., a collection of links to your work, talks, projects, blog
posts, etc.

Submissions **must** be made through Pretalx
(https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/cfp) no later than Wednesday December
10, 2025.

The suggested duration for a talk is **25 minutes** (20 minutes presentation +
5 minutes Q&A). However, we *explicitly* invite you to propose the best
duration for your talk. If the best way to present your project is a **5-minute
lightning talk**, we'll happily arrange a lightning session!

Depending on the proposals, we may contact you to adapt the time of the session
to fit the devroom schedule.

Once the devroom schedule is finalized, we will contact you to help you prepare
your talk.

informal "friends of email" dinner/drinks session either on Satuday evening,
January 31.  Please email one of the organizers or join the matrix channel if
